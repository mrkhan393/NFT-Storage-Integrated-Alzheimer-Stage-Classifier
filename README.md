# ðŸ§  MRI Brain Scan Classifier + NFT Minting on Blockchain

This project is a smart mix of **AI** and **blockchain** it can predict the stage of Alzheimerâ€™s from an **MRI image** using a trained deep learning model and stores the result as an **NFT** on a local Ethereum blockchain.

Itâ€™s like a brain scan doctor that gives you a prediction and saves it on the blockchain!

---

## What It Does

1. You upload a brain MRI image.
2. The system checks if it really looks like an MRI (not a random cat photo).
3. If valid, it predicts the Alzheimer's stage using a deep learning model.
4. The prediction and confidence scores are stored on the blockchain as NFT metadata.
5. You get back the result and the blockchain transaction hash.

## Technologies Used

### AI & Image Processing
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras** â€“ to load the trained model.
- **Pillow** â€“ to handle images (convert to grayscale, resize, etc).
- **NumPy** â€“ to prepare image arrays.
- **imagehash** â€“ to compare the uploaded image with real MRI examples.

### Backend & Web Server
- **Flask** â€“ the backend server for prediction and blockchain interaction.
- **dotenv** â€“ to load private keys and secrets safely.

### Blockchain
- **Solidity** â€“ smart contract (`NFTStorage.sol`) to store prediction NFTs.
- **Web3.py** â€“ to talk to the Ethereum blockchain from Python.
- **Hardhat** â€“ to run a local Ethereum network and deploy the contract.

### Frontend
- **HTML + JavaScript** â€“ minimal UI to upload images and view results.

## How to Run This Locally

> Make sure you have Python and Node.js installed.

### 1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mri-nft-classifier.git
cd mri-nft-classifier

### 2. Set up Python environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
Create a .env file and add:
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
ACCOUNT_ADDRESS=your_account_address
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_deployed_contract_address

### 4. Start the blockchain (Hardhat)
In a separate terminal:
npx hardhat node

And deploy the smart contract:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
Update .env with the contract address you get after deployment.

### 5. Run the Flask server
python app.py

### 6. Open the app
Visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser.
Testing
Try uploading:

A real MRI image â†’ Should give prediction + NFT hash.
A random image â†’ Should tell you it's not a MRI image.

Fun Fact
This project was built to show how AI and blockchain can work together, combining health predictions with the trust and transparency of decentralized storage.
